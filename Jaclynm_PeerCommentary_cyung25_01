## this is my homework 1 code
## Lines 12-22 are Challenge 1
## Lines 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library (stringr)
sentence <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.”"
words <- str_split_1(sentence, "\\s+")[[1]]
words_clean <- gsub ("[[:punct:]]","",words)
length (words_clean)
if (length(words_clean) >=3)
{third_words <- words_clean[seq(3, length(words_clean), by = 3)]} 
{third_words <- character (0)  }
third_words

#PEER COMMENTARY NOTE:When I ran this code I did not get every 3rd word I got "chatacter (0)", On line 16, you don't need the [[1]], and you don't need lines 18 and 19, it should work after removing those!
m <- matrix (1:100, nrow=10, ncol = 10)
x_columns <- m[, c(2,3,6)]
x_rows <- m[6:8, ]
xrange <- m[2:6,9:2]
x_columns
x_rows
```
#Peer Commentary: For the Matrix it should benrow=8

```{r}
x <- array (400:1, dim = c(5,5,4,4))
x [1,1,1,2]
x [2,3,2, ]
x [1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]

```

## Challenge 4 Codes:
use character vectors
List and C
Str for view
print is easy to read
```{r}
primate_taxonomy <- list(Primates = list(Haplorhini = list(Anthropoidea = list(Platyrrhini = c("Cebidae", "Atelidae", "Pitheciidae"), Catarrhini = c("Cercopithecidae", "Hylobatidae", "Hominidae")), Tarsioidea = c("Tarsiidae")),Strepsirhini = list(Lorisoidea = c("Lorisidae", "Galagidae"),Lemuroidea = c("Cheirogaleidae", "Lepilemuridae", "Indriidae", "Lemuridae", "Daubentoniidae"))))
str(primate_taxonomy)
print(primate_taxonomy)
```
## Challenge 5 

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(matrix(
  c(3, 0, 1, 
    23, 1, 2, 
    33, 1, 1, 
    42, 0, 1, 
    41, 0, 2), 
  nrow = 5, 
  byrow = TRUE
))
df [[2]] <- as.logical(df[[2]])
df [[3]] <- as.factor(df[[3]])
str(df)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#PEER COMMENTARY: This looks really good! Looking at your code helped me understand each challenge better and also how to make things look nice on html!
